// I need to better understand the logic for this page and what it's doing.
// My ideal scenario is that users click on my link to the newsletter,
// they are prompted to enter a password, and then they can read the newsletter.
// There's just one password for everyone, so I don't need to store user data.
// I think this is what this page is doing, but I need to verify that.
// I also need to verify that this is the best way to do this.
// I also want to set up the app so that there's no sign out button.
// I just want users to be able to read the newsletter once they enter the password.
// But for security reasons, I want the page to sign out automatically when the page reloads.
