# monthly highlights

## 2024

The very **first week of 2024** I attended the RAY fellowship retreat in New Orleans. The fellowship places underrepresented professionals in jobs all over the U.S. Therefore, I’d never met most of the fellows. I went into the trip very anxious about spending a whole week with a bunch of randoms, only to come out of the trip with new perspectives, inspiration, and appreciation for the ways people support each other without realizing.

My mom and I spent all of **February** in India to Eat, Pray, Love… or so I thought. Throughout the trip, my mom and I ended up having a lot of difficult but long overdue conversations about our relationship. I watched Eat Pray Love on the return flight and found that the movie actually validated my experience: Julia Roberts only Prays (AKA does a lot of serious reflection) in India. There is no Eating or Loving in India (Joke. Obviously).

Genuinely, my main takeaway was that healing isn’t meant to be a pleasant experience. At that time, I really needed to hear that (thanks universe).

Before leaving for India, I signed a contract with a [non-profit art gallery in Baltimore](https://galleryreimagined.org/artists/). I started to take my art so seriously. When I returned from India, I worked on art almost every day of **March and April**. I was amazed at how much satisfaction I found in consistency itself.

**May 2024**, I spent my 24th birthday at King’s Dominion with my family before I left for New Zealand to visit Stevie!

A while back, a former professor asked me about attending Reed during Covid (if you’re reading this, Hi Kelly!). I remember saying something along the lines of “post-graduation, I find myself missing friends I never had the chance to make.” When I said this, I was thinking of Stevie.

My trip to New Zealand not only solidified mine and Stevie’s friendship into its ✨iconic existence✨. (Thanks to a good bit of peer pressure from Stevie), I also met Mareko who I’ve grown to love more than I can explain.

Mareko and I dated for just over a year, officially ending things on loving terms one month ago. Being with Mareko redefined my standards for what love can and should be. He made what I thought to be impossible in a relationship feel unquestionably natural. I now know that I really can find someone who communicates openly and listens with care. I now understand the exact ways in which love is not about obligation or ownership. From Mareko, I’ve learned how much love can simply be about intentionality.

I feel so terribly lucky to have met him.

The months after I came back from New Zealand were an absolute whirlwind. In **August**, I went to Hawaii with Sarena. I visited Eve and Monique in New Mexico. And somewhere in between, I moved from Boston, a city I loved, to New York, fulfilling a childhood dream.

Mareko spent all of **September** with me; life felt like a movie. **October**, I transitioned from working full-time to working as a contractor so I could complete a program in software engineering. **November**, I competed in my first CrossFit competition.

## 2025

Suddenly, it was 2025. I earned my software engineering certification. I traveled to South Africa, Spain, and Morocco and unlocked new levels in my friendship with Val 😎. When I returned to the states, I first flailed and then learned to enjoy being unemployed, bringing me all the way up to the midway point of 2025, July 2nd.

July 2nd, I signed the contract for a new job.

# big change ahead

Tomorrow (7/23/25), I move back to Maryland for the first time in 7 years.

## why?

Shortly after I finished my software engineering course in New York, I visited home to go hiking with my dad. Since I was a tween, I’ve often said my dad is my homie. However, that statement has honestly felt a bit hollow for years… until this February. A Sunday hike in Central Maryland was the first time in a long time that my dad felt like my friend again. I needed 7 miles in the woods with my dad to realize: all the therapy and fighting and conversations do pay off. Parents may never be the exact people we want them to be, but…

> The point of healing is not to return to a place where everything is perfect. Instead, it is to begin to develop the ability to respond to what's imperfect

Again, love can simply be about intentionality.

My dad’s knees started to buckle on the way down from our hike, reminding me that one day, we’ll have our last hike together. Since that realization, I’ve only grown more sure that before that day comes, I want to go on as many hikes together as possible.

I’ll admit: I don’t know how long I’ll stay sane living with my parents. I’ll also admit that I haven’t really gotten my fill of living in New York; I’m very sad to be leaving. I’ll miss walking outside with an almost-guarantee that I’ll see a dog wearing shoes. At the same time, I know that New York, Boston—﹘Every place I’ve lived and loved will always be a place, somewhere I can return to (I know I'll stay in touch with the people who matter); My parents, on the other hand, will always be mortal, and are, at the end of the day, my oldest friends (read as "likely the closest to death"). I rather try to be close with my parents and fail than not try at all.

I’m also content to move home so that I can build a solid financial foundation. Since my first job at the age of 14, I’ve talked a lot about valuing financial stability and independence but have never taken necessary steps to achieve either (as my therapist would say, my values and ethics have not aligned). So, the ability to more quickly pay off my student loans in Maryland and live debt-free was another significant factor in my decision to move home.

Realizing what fulfilling relationships I’ve cultivated with both of my parents was the deciding factor.

# now

That was quite a bit about where I’ve been and a little bit about where I’m going, which leaves the question “where am I now?”

The truth is that I feel more unsure of myself than I’ve ever felt. I haven’t touched my artwork in over a year now. Any suggestion of painting or drawing sends me spiraling; I wonder if I even enjoy making art anymore.

In the most recent weeks of my unemployment, I’ve been telling my sisters, “There are so many paths forward. I just can’t find any that excite me.” I feel most happy walking aimlessly through the city and (re)connecting with good company. If anyone knows how to turn these pastimes into my career, let me know! If not, I invite you to (re)visit this simple poem with me:

Until next time,\
Amrita\
